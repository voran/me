                    I was born into a family of scientists, and was raised to love science in all its forms.
                    I also developed an early interest in music, and started playing the piano at the age of six.
                    Nowadays I mostly play guitar and clarinet. I also enjoy travelling and outdoor photography.
                    I love hiking, camping, skiing, and swimming.
                    I have travelled to many places in the United States and Europe, and I will travel to many more whenever I get the chance.

                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>
                    I provide efficient solutions to real-world problems. I use bleeding edge 
                    software for my personal projects and infrastructure, which enables me to keep up with emerging technologies. 
                    I often promote these techonologies if I feel they will improve productivity, performance, and/or developer happiness.
                    I love open source.
                    
                    I thrive in any work environment that encourages innovation. I have experience working with big companies
                     (<a href="http://amazon.com" itemprop="affiliation">Amazon</a>), as well as startups (<a href="http://transmetrics.eu" itemprop="affiliation">Transmetrics</a>).

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    My interests in Computer Science are in the areas of Operating Systems, Algorithms, and Distributed Systems.
                    I think P != NP, and I'll live to see it proven.
                    I like Java, but I also like the low-level stuff: C, Assembly.
                    I run Arch Linux on all my devices, except my phone. It runs MeeGo.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests in Economics are mainly in the field of Economic Policy.
                    I believe that the economy needs some regulation, because competition is *not* perfect in the real world.
                    There is no perfect information. Most markets "suffer" from economies of scale.
