                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria on 15 September 1989. This makes me exactly <span id="age"></span> old. 
                    I was born into a family of scientists, and was raised to love science in all its forms.
                    I also developed an early interest in music, and started playing the piano at the age of 6.
                    Nowadays I mostly play guitar and clarinet. I also enjoy travelling and outdoor photography.
                    I love hiking, camping, skiing, and swimming.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Math from the American University in Bulgaria.
                    I also spent one semester in the Otto-von-Guericke University in Magdeburg, Germany as an Erasmus Student.
                    During my senior year, I received the Bulgarian Young Leaders Award for 2011 and spent three quarters at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    My interests in Computer Science are in the areas of Operating Systems, Algorithms, and Distributed Systems.
                    I think P != NP, and I'll live to see it proven.
                    I like Java, but I also like the low-level stuff: C, Assembly.
                    I run Arch Linux on all my devices, except my phone. It runs MeeGo.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests in Economics are mainly in the field of Economic Policy.
                    I believe that the economy needs some regulation, because competition is *not* perfect in the real world.
                    There is no perfect information. Most markets suffer from economies of scale.
