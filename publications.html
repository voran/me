                <h4>Hydrofracking in Europe: Rights, Risks, and Challenges</h4>
                <p>
                    This paper examines the property rights that exist in two European countries where shale gas is currently being extracted – the United Kingdom and Poland.
                    It introduces the parties being directly or indirectly influenced by hydrofracking, and the legislation that is put in place to protect their respective rights. 
                    It also presents the institutions involved with enforcing these rights. 
                    Finally, it provides a summary of economic research on the subject, and concludes with my consulting opinion.

                <h4>Determinants of New Car Prices in the U.S.</h4>
                <p>
                    This was my final paper for the Economic Forecasting class I took at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
                    It studies the price of new cars in the United States from 1969 to 2011. 
                    The data set used contains 172 quarterly observations of new car prices,  used car prices, public transportation prices, insurance prices, and installment credit. 
                    No data has been seasonally adjusted. It tries a number of economic forecasting models to find the one that provides the best fit for the data.

                <h4>Thoughts on "AI Debates &amp; Watson on Jeopardy"</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a 2-page commentary on <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/watson-still-cant-think/" target="blank">a New York Times Article</a> about whether Watson (IBM's supercomputer, not Sherlock Holmes' friend) can actually think.
                    It cites John Searle's "Minds, Brains and Programs", Stanely Fish's "What Did Watson the Computer Do?" and Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".

                <h4>An Essay on Existentialism</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a short overview of the main theories of existentialism. It presents the idea of Thomas Nagel's article "The Absurd", which claims that life is, well, absurd.
                    It then moves on to present  the ideas behind "The Meaning of Human Existence" by Richard Taylor - a more optimistic view, which argues that some of us live meaningful lives.
